  // Intro
  const introHeader = 'Introduction';
  const introText = `
    As we approach 2025, website optimization continues to evolve at a rapid pace. 
    AI-driven algorithms demand high-quality, context-rich content, while user expectations 
    for speed, security, and personalized experiences keep rising. This guide explores 
    essential strategies to optimize both your front-end (what users see) and your back-end 
    (what search engines and browsers require). By staying proactive, you can ensure your 
    site remains relevant and high-performing well into 2025.
    
    Moreover, beyond the typical optimizations, modern web experiences must account for AI-driven 
    personalization, advanced caching strategies, and the ever-growing mobile user base. 
    From minifying scripts to leveraging serverless infrastructures, every layer of your 
    site's technology stack plays a role in delivering a smoother user experience.
  `;

  // Section 1
  const section1Heading = '1. Core Web Vitals and Technical Foundations';
  const section1Subhead1 = '1.1 Understanding LCP, FID, CLS';
  const section1Text1 = `
    Core Web Vitals are crucial ranking signals focusing on:
    - Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): How quickly main content is rendered.
    - First Input Delay (FID): How responsive your site is to user interactions.
    - Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): How stable your layout remains while loading.

    By optimizing these metrics—using a CDN, minifying scripts, and compressing images—
    you'll deliver faster, more stable user experiences. 
    Also consider lazy-loading non-critical elements and deferring scripts to prioritize 
    above-the-fold content. Ensuring a smooth user experience correlates directly with 
    longer on-page dwell time and lower bounce rates.
  `;

  const section1Subhead2 = '1.2 Server and Hosting Optimizations';
  const section1Text2 = `
    Server-side improvements can drastically reduce TTFB (Time To First Byte). 
    Employ server caching, use HTTP/2 or HTTP/3, and enable SSL certificates for better 
    security and user trust. Investing in robust hosting with SSD storage and auto-scaling 
    capabilities can help your site handle traffic spikes without performance dips.

    For high-traffic sites, consider load balancers and container orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes) 
    to dynamically scale resources. This prevents slowdowns during peak times and ensures 
    consistent performance across the globe. 
  `;

  // Section 2
  const section2Heading = '2. Mobile-First Design and Accessibility';
  const section2Subhead1 = '2.1 Mobile Usability';
  const section2Text1 = `
    Mobile devices account for the majority of global web traffic. Ensure fluid layouts, 
    legible fonts, and tap-friendly buttons. Also consider mobile-specific features 
    like click-to-call functionality, location-aware content, and optimized media queries 
    to reduce load times on slower connections.

    Keep in mind that "mobile-first" is also about SEO. Google indexes many sites 
    primarily based on their mobile version. If your mobile site is incomplete or 
    has missing structured data, your rankings may suffer.
  `;

  const section2Subhead2 = '2.2 Accessibility Standards';
  const section2Text2 = `
    Meeting WCAG guidelines (e.g., text contrast, alt attributes, keyboard navigation) 
    improves usability for everyone. Use semantic HTML tags—<header>, <nav>, <main>, <footer>— 
    so assistive technologies can parse your content effectively. Color contrast checkers 
    and screen reader testing are essential to uncover hidden barriers.

    Ultimately, accessibility is not only about compliance; it also expands your 
    potential audience. A site that accommodates diverse user needs fosters 
    stronger brand loyalty and trust.
  `;

  // Section 3
  const section3Heading = '3. On-Page SEO and Content Strategy';
  const section3Subhead1 = '3.1 High-Quality, Context-Rich Content';
  const section3Text1 = `
    Google's AI-driven search algorithms can detect keyword stuffing and superficial content. 
    Instead, produce in-depth articles that address user intent comprehensively. 
    Incorporate synonyms and related terms naturally to give search engines a fuller picture 
    of your page's topic. 
    
    Think of each page as a chance to become the authoritative source on a particular subject. 
    Rich media like infographics or videos can also engage readers and reduce bounce rates.
  `;

  const section3Subhead2 = '3.2 Meta Tags, Headings, and Internal Linking';
  const section3Text2 = `
    Well-crafted title tags and meta descriptions entice clicks from SERPs. 
    Logical heading structures (H1, H2, H3) guide both users and search engines. 
    Internal links with descriptive anchor text help visitors explore related content 
    and improve crawlability. Group related pages into thematic clusters for clarity.

    For example, if you have a series of posts on "Website Optimization," link them together 
    to signal to Google that you have a comprehensive library of content on that topic.
  `;

  // Section 4
  const section4Heading = '4. Performance Testing and Monitoring';
  const section4Subhead1 = '4.1 Lighthouse and PageSpeed Insights';
  const section4Text1 = `
    Run regular audits using Google's Lighthouse or PageSpeed Insights to track LCP, FID, and CLS, 
    as well as accessibility and SEO best practices. Achieving near-perfect scores is good, 
    but real-world user data (collected via the Chrome User Experience Report) often 
    paints a more accurate picture of performance.

    Analyze the "Opportunities" section in PageSpeed Insights to see recommended 
    fixes like removing unused JavaScript or compressing images further.
  `;

  const section4Subhead2 = '4.2 Real User Monitoring';
  const section4Text2 = `
    Beyond synthetic tests, tools like New Relic or Datadog provide real user monitoring (RUM) 
    data, measuring actual load times on various devices and network conditions. These insights 
    help prioritize which pages or elements need the most urgent optimization.

    Additionally, consider setting up custom event tracking so you know exactly which 
    performance metrics have the biggest impact on conversions and user engagement.
  `;

  // Section 5
  const section5Heading = '5. Future-Proofing and Continuous Updates';
  const section5Subhead1 = '5.1 Emerging Technologies';
  const section5Text1 = `
    Keep an eye on Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), voice search integration, and AI-driven 
    personalization. Users increasingly expect app-like features in the browser, 
    real-time chat assistance, and context-aware recommendations.

    Additionally, 5G networks may change how you deliver media-rich content. 
    With faster speeds, you might incorporate higher resolution images or videos 
    without tanking performance—but always test carefully.
  `;

  const section5Subhead2 = '5.2 Regular Content Refreshes';
  const section5Text2 = `
    Outdated information can hurt credibility. Schedule periodic audits of older posts 
    and landing pages, updating facts, stats, or visuals to remain authoritative. 
    Regularly patch and update your CMS and plugins to prevent security vulnerabilities 
    and maintain performance.

    In some cases, simply reorganizing your site's taxonomy or merging thin articles 
    into a comprehensive guide can boost overall rankings and reader satisfaction.
  `;

  // Conclusion
  const conclusionHeader = 'Conclusion';
  const conclusionText = `
    Optimizing for 2025 means mastering Core Web Vitals, embracing mobile and accessibility, 
    and crafting content that resonates with both search engines and real people. 
    Keep testing your site's performance, stay informed about algorithm shifts, 
    and adopt new tech that enhances user experiences. 
    By combining technical excellence with user-centric design, 
    you'll position your website for sustainable success well into the future.
    
    Remember that optimization is an ongoing process. Continually review analytics, 
    user feedback, and emerging best practices to stay ahead of the curve.
